# SmartFlow
This is the Repo for all SmartFlow files that were used in the project.
This project aims to reduce the average commute time by focusing on relieving congestion
at intersections using a camera sensing, machine learning, and smart traffic monitoring system.

It applies a set of rules (algorithm) to the intersection to control phase timings based on congestion status,
with the ability to send data to external services for further processing.
