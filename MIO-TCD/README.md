MIO-TCD includes:
- Three helper scripts that converted the MIO-TCD dataset to be used for YOLO

- the data.yaml file that is used during YOLO training
- This folder does not include the dataset because it is too large to upload
- These scripts here also randomly convert 10 percent of the photos into a validation set, so each instance of conversion is different
